# Assembly-Calculator (University Project)
This project was developed as part of a university assessment under a tight deadline.
It is a simple calculator implemented in Assembly code, capable of performing basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, error handling and a quit feature).
The software used was custom-made; it did not include some basic functions a typical CPU has, and the 3rd and 4th gates could not be used.
This gave me practical experience writing and debugging Assembly code, understanding how the CPU works and its inner functions and allowed me to learn about arithmetic logic in a low-level enviroment.

# Downloading and extraction
Once you have downloaded the files, extract them to a folder or to the desktop.

# To view the raw assembly code:
1. Launch Sting.exe. You should see a yellow box with two white boxes to the left and right.
2. Click "Load Code" on the top left; it will open a folder called Sources. (If you cannot find it, it's within the main folder as a subfolder.)
3. Click on Assembly_Calculator_Source.was and click "Open" at the bottom right.
4. You should now see all the assembly code in the left section.

# To run the Calculator function:
1. Launch Wasp.exe. You should see the layout of a CPU.
2. Under "Cheats," deselect "Animations" to speed up the calculator significantly.
3. Click "File" on the top right and select "Load Program."
4. A folder called Hexecutables will appear. If it doesn't, you can find it in the main folder.
5. Click on Assembly_Calculator.wex and open it.
6. Back on the main screen, go to "Windows" → "Peripherals" → "ZangMicro Console."
7. After the console appears, go back to the main program and press the green play arrow to launch the code.
8. You should now see the main program working. On the console, the text "Example: 01+09 xx to quit" will appear. The calculator is now ready to use.

# HOW TO OPERATE THE CALCULATOR

This calculator can only take one digit/input at a time and only accepts five inputs in total.
To input an operation, follow this pattern: [NUMBER] → Enter → [NUMBER] → Enter → [SIGN] → Enter → [NUMBER] → Enter → [NUMBER] → Answer
If done incorrectly, the calculator will display an error.

# Disclaimer 
This Calculator does not cover everything, it may break and/or give unexpected outputs on some inputs.
